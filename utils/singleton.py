# Based on https://stackoverflow.com/q/6760685 - creating
# singletons with metaclasses. Namely, any class which should
# be a singleton should inherit `metaclass=Singleton` in its constructor
# On the first instantiaion, the single instance will be created and added
# to the global _instances dictionary

# When the instance is destroyed, 

_instances = {}
