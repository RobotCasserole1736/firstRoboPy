This folder is a hack - it's a copy of commit 31acc2a4fa1fd0528fbb06a230147d65a3bc8992 in https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner - the side branch specifically where "pure-python" support was added. It should probably be removed the 2024 season actually starts and we should move over to whateve rthe latest pathplanner support is. However.... for now at least... we'll see if it works.
